I have been watching your videos for so long, it really feels like yesterday when I started to watch you, like back in 2013. And now we are all here. I love the fact that I somehow still feel connected with you, since I believe we have similar humours, we want a quiet life (maybe I dunno) and now we both have a son.

You're not perfect but you're human but you never gave up what you beloved in. We all got your back whatever you guys decide. Family comes first. We'll always be here. They're getting big. It's a good feeling and a shitty feeling. Good because you're experiencing life the best that you can do. Sucks because life is inevitable. I haven't watched you in a long time I am sorry but I saw a post of you and mars 10 years ago and it was nestelgic because I remember everything up to you having a family. I knew you'd be busy as a father and devoted husband so I stopped watching. You're a good man.

There must be something you don't like or didn't like about japan, but for now you seems to be having fun in japan. I'm not a big fan of you, but as a fan, as a subscriber, I really like your home video type of video. simply it feels like sharing happiness of yours and its great. By the way, last time I watched your video was when you moved to japan. Compare to that video, i can see you are adapting to japan,  or more likely getting Japanese. What I meant is that, many Japanese love feeling seasons. Smelling, eating, touching, watching and eating again. Every month we do something related to season. January we celebrate New year and eat mochi, February we give valentine and endure severe cold winter with snow with Setsubun, March we have Ohinasama and ready to have spring with Ume as you did in this video. In April we  celebrate spring, sakura with the start of school(年度）, in May we get extra holidays generally called as ""golden week"" and get some little vacation with peach flower (momo no ki no hana), in June we get wet with Tsuyu (rainy season)with noisy semi and wait to see summer (vacation). In July we go Natsu matsuri and Hanabi. August we welcome and mourn ancestors with silent semi with smell of kou. In September, these days its still summer, but getting ready for fall season. For example, inakari( harvesting rice), Moon watching, higan bana and kinmokusei is ready to see, sakura trees most likely to change color by this time. In October, there's aki matsuri( fall festival) most likely harvest festival, which comes with kuri, mushrooms and etc. In November we get ready for winter. There's 7 5 3 events, most maples get turn in to red, so sightseeing is one of popular event. In December, its time to ready for Christmas time( more likely eating cake time or date time or Santa time for kids), then ready to end of the year. Generally we tidy up all rooms and ready for food to eat. Some may ready mochi, osechi, to stay in home and watch TV. Some may go to see end of the year live, some may go to temple for 108 bells, some may go to shrine to start dash the new year, some may go higher point to see sun rise. 
Sorry for messaging with such a essay. what I want tell is that, how you are having fun season is really great. Japanese watch, eat and feel every seasons by aging every year with sweet and bitter memories.

I would have so much more peace of mind for my child if I could. The US raises so many concerns for my child.,0,2025-03-19T15:10:26Z,2025-03-19T15:10:26Z

There would be others to take the next step, higher summits would inevitably be trodden, and kings crowned to rule them. He did not need them, he did not need their domain, and their accolades meant little to him. To truly win, he let go. He stayed his feet and remained the man who began the long march. Maybe his son will look back on Pewdiepie videos and wonder how his dad truly changed the world. But to Felix, his world is not so vast. This is his world, here in his arms, on his knee, and it is well won and spent. Live well and prosper my dude.",0,2025-03-18T20:08:17Z,2025-03-18T20:08:17Z

彼らは日本人に似ているので日本人になりすますことができる。
日本人の名前を語り、そして完全に日本人になりすましています。

I lived in the Tokyo area for 11 years, met my wife there, had a child there, and then moved to Canada for various reasons. We had a second child here in Canada, and just last year, our youngest visited Japan for the first time. Both of my kids are dual citizens, so they can easily live in Japan, even though they don't speak Japanese. My oldest used to be able to, but lost the ability since we moved to Canada when she was 4. She's studying Japanese now, though.

It's always been in the back of my mind that I want to live in Japan again. When we left Japan, I had a job I enjoyed, but we realised that we didn't want our daughter to be educated in Japan. That and my wife didn't want to stay in Japan. We've been in Canada for 9 years now, which I can't believe. There's a good chance that we'll inherit my in-laws' house in the future, which means we'll have a place to live if we decide to move to Japan. Watching Japan vlogs really gives me nostalgic feelings and a sense of longing for my old life. I truly loved living there. Time goes too fast.",0,2025-03-18T00:31:34Z,2025-03-18T00:31:34Z

- Japanese people are generally polite, but it's difficult to make friends with them—especially young Japanese men, often aren’t open to new friendships. My husband has been living in Japan for 14 years and still doesn’t have a single close Japanese male friend. It’s usually easier to befriend Japanese women, but both men and women take longer to become frank and friendly compared to people from other countries. Many of my foreign friends have also struggled to make Japanese friends.
- Japan lacks diversity and isn’t foreigner/minority-friendly in many ways. You'll see this once you live here. You need to be able to speak Japanese to live here comfortably.
- Watch out for cedar pollen allergies! There was a massive cedar plantation project decades ago, but many trees haven’t been left uncut due to a labor shortage. This has led to severe allergy issues, with people in Japan spending over 400 billion yen per year on medical expenses related to cedar pollen allergies.",1,2025-03-16T13:15:34Z,2025-03-16T13:15:34Z

I've been there for many years, through his Amnesia times, the Funny Montages, his Blue Hair era, the Beard era, Meme Reviews and now I am once again back at his channel, watching his Japan Blogs. This is the best possible outcome that I could've wished for my Childhood Hero.

I am now 23 years old and tomorrow I start my first job. His videos have made me laugh through many dark times in my life and I wish him, his family, his friends and you, whoever is reading this, many good times and that you may have all the love and support throughout the hard times.

When you moved to Japan i was so happy for you and myself too, because i could live vicariously through you in what i perceive to be my true place of belonging. This video has strengthened my recently increasing want to move there, something I've wanted since i started watching you a decade ago after finding anime too. I've made up my mind to just DO IT. Next year, it's happening. I've decided on Osaka, but I LOVE Tokyo too.

Maybe someday, you and i can meet, shake hands (or bow politely), maybe have a drink together, play some darts (my favorite thing to do while going to a bar) and become friends? I'll be looking for some. Who knows.

Anyway. I want to wish you, Marzia, Bjorn and the dogs (rest in peace, Maya) a truly happy, fulfilling life. That your omikujis come out fortunate and that you all stay healthy.

Sincerely, a long time fan of yours.",1,2025-03-16T07:47:37Z,2025-03-16T07:47:37Z

His videos have brought me so much joy, and like him, I’ve always had a deep love for Japan. In December 2024, I married my Japanese girlfriend and started a new life in Japan.

My mindset has changed alongside PewDiePie’s videos—just like how he went from screaming at barrels to slowing down and enjoying life. Perhaps one day, we’ll also consider having a cute child.

I just want to say that PewDiePie’s videos always bring back memories of my younger days up until now. I’m truly grateful for his content, and I also appreciate how wholesome and positive the PewDiePie community is.",342,2025-03-16T01:28:39Z,2025-03-16T01:28:39Z

They have been with me through some of the most confusing and difficult times in my life, and to see them blossom into what they have been lately, is truly captivating and inspiring.
Thank you so much for allowing us a glimpse into your lives, and mind, as these flourish into something that no words can do justice.

it’s great to grow up in different places abroad, it really opened my eyes and heart to so many things but at the same time I missed a lot of “family time” w like grandparents and having that intimate community growing up, while at the same time my parents moving back “home” did not per se help w that bc I had already made other places my home and separating from there was also hard… so honestly all of it is just difficult. However, one thing that was missed by the generation of my parents when they entered this new “global world”-era was that they didn’t realize how difficult it was for me and my siblings to constantly move while growing up (I’m talking like ages 6, 10, 12 (not like toddler ages or teenage years)) and always having to say goodbye etc and our parents not understanding that due to the fact that they got to spend their childhood in one place/country/home… I understand that it was hard for them to imagine as well but it would have been nice to have that extra care, attention and understanding from my parents who decided to move around so often…

It gives you the closest to a ""normal"" life you could have.

In Europe you will always be ""pestered"" by your celebrity status.

In Japan this seemingly will not happen nearly as much, and therefor also Bjoern will have more of a normal upbringing.

Of course it sucks to be so far off your family and that Bjoerns gradnparents wont be as much a part of his upbringing, but i think that might be a worthwhile trade off.",0,2025-03-15T08:33:30Z,2025-03-15T08:33:30Z

参考になれば、、
保育園ならポピンズ系列が安心です。セレブ向け保育を行ってきた老舗でとても丁寧に対応してくれます。
幼稚園なら本当は東京都市大学二子幼稚園が昔から有名人のお子さんを預かっており受験を目指している人にはお勧めですが、あなたはそうではないと思います。こどもの自主性を育てたいならモンテッソーリ系列の二子玉川こどものいえも良いと思います。日本では株式会社系（ポピンズの老舗園以外）と無認可はあまりお勧めできません。株式でないモンテッソーリ教育・シュタイナー教育が合っているのではないかなーと思いますので、色々と見学してみてください。（※なぜ株式会社系列がダメのかは、利益追求のために創設されている為人件費が安く良い人材が集まりにくい為です。中にはそうではない所もありますが見抜くのは難しいです。ポピンズさんは質の確保の為に売り手市場の保育士も採用で落とされることがあり、職員教育が徹底しています。）園によってはプレやサマースクール、一時預かりを行っていますので申し込んでみるのも良いと思います。しかし、日本では見学申し込みは基本的に電話になりますので、通訳の方に代わりに電話してもらいながら対応するのが確実だと思います！お父さん、お母さん、がんばって！！応援してます。
☆見学当日は園からNGが出ない限り夫婦とお子さん揃って見学し、担当者との会話や質問などはお母さんが行った方が良いと思います。通訳さんいれば尚良し！お父さんはお子さんを抱っこもしくは歩かせながら周囲の先生（特に先生同士の関係性）や子供の様子をよく観察してください。短い時間の見学では夫婦の役割分担が大切です。違和感があればやめた方が良いと思います。ただ、こちらの勘違いもあるのでその場で直接聞いてしまうのも有りです。
☆今日本人の中で子供の教育の為に軽井沢のある長野県に移住する人が増えています。自然の中で自主性を育む教育に注目が集まっており、あなたならそういう選択肢もあっても良いかもしれません。",2,2025-03-15T03:54:53Z,2025-03-15T03:59:06Z

Although English is my first language, I can very fluently speak Japanese and Korean as well despite having very little formal education on either of those languages. I just wanted to say this because you jokingly mentioned that Bjorn would have to learn 4 languages, but I wanted you to understand that, at least from my experience, I didn't feel like I was ""having to learn"" 3 languages, as my Japanese and Korean came naturally to me just as English have, although to a lesser degree. I have many other friends with similar experiences that can also speak 2-4 different languages, and I just think that Bjorn is in a super fortunate position to grow up to become multilingual. Anyways, congrats on making the decision to stay, I'm also in a position right now where I'm needing to choose where I want to go and where I want to live, and I understand the feeling of having to decide between being in close proximity of the people and places dear to you, no matter what you end up deciding on.",0,2025-03-14T23:22:41Z,2025-03-14T23:22:41Z

You know, I still regularly see people hate and judge Felix whenever certain drama comes up as if he is the same person he was years ago. People should be allowed to grow and change. I'm sure they'd hope people would allow them to do the same. I don't recall him doing anything extremely heinous, maybe just somewhat offensive.

It's really hard, but the fever is natural and good(until it starts really affecting them like altered speech and the like) and if they're acting fine beyond a cough or throwing up they don't always need fever reducers.

Not trying to act like I know everything, but I've been sick a lot in my life and if I take Tylenol or Advil and cold showers I feel like crap, if I wrap myself up to make sure I'm not cold I sleep and feel better quicker, my children as well.

You can research it yourself, but I remember there are researches that says that growing up learning multiple languages trained your brain more to think critically. I think it makes sense because learning different languages is also learning different cultural perspectives. It basically broadens your general point of view. The bigger the difference between languages learnt, the broader your point of view will become, the more critical you're when seeing things. 

Making kids grow up learning to be a polyglot will also make it easier for them to learn better of any other studies later on. Because their brains are already better used to learning.",0,2025-03-14T21:22:52Z,2025-03-14T21:24:14Z

Whereas before when you were in UK for example, you guys seemed more restricted in the every day pleasures.

I remember when I was a kid, my dad would take my brother and I out on adventures on Saturday morning. and he would wake us up at like 6am and would tell us to get dressed and be super quiet. he told us that we have to be silent like Ninjas to get out of the house. and that we are going on an adventure. this was his way to get us out of the house. we would often ride our bikes to somewhere to get breakfast. 
this would allow my mom to sleep in till like 8 or 9. and then would often drive over to meet us for breakfast. those were some of my most favorite memories and I really hope more fathers would do the same as well. 😊",2,2025-03-14T17:29:12Z,2025-03-14T17:29:12Z

UgyH81PuQdjrc3t1ixJ4AaABAg,@itseveryday8600,UCQFWDKoPCpKq5-o_ZUgpTdg,"Pewds, just make plans in case there is a major earthquake around Tokyo. When a huge earth quake hits, they turn school gymnasiums into a local shelter, (because houses will collapse & water electricity may be cut off, so cant stay in the house). These shelters will not let pets stay, so may be forced to leave them at your house, or, some people choose to live in their car with their pet instead ( because there is no other choice). 

A lot of Japanese people have a backpack with emergency amenities ready, e.g torch, sanitary products etc, so when an earth quake comes, they have things ready. Roads could get compromised, and shops unable to open with lack of electricity means you may not be able to purchase necessary products for your family. Also, when you stay in a shelter, people expect you to share things to, they will put pressure on you to give up items that you own, you need plenty of items stocked up. Ideally, you want to avoid staying in a shelter in the first place, as there are a lot of unpleasant things that unfortunately occur in those place, even violence & sexual assualt ( because you end up sharing a roof with people from all walks of life, even criminals), so if you can, have a get away plan, to drive out of Tokyo, to other regions in Japan that were spared by the quake.",0,2025-03-14T17:25:19Z,2025-03-14T17:36:00Z

I have been watching your videos for so long, it really feels like yesterday when I started to watch you, like back in 2013. And now we are all here. I love the fact that I somehow still feel connected with you, since I believe we have similar humours, we want a quiet life (maybe I dunno) and now we both have a son.

You're not perfect but you're human but you never gave up what you beloved in. We all got your back whatever you guys decide. Family comes first. We'll always be here. They're getting big. It's a good feeling and a shitty feeling. Good because you're experiencing life the best that you can do. Sucks because life is inevitable. I haven't watched you in a long time I am sorry but I saw a post of you and mars 10 years ago and it was nestelgic because I remember everything up to you having a family. I knew you'd be busy as a father and devoted husband so I stopped watching. You're a good man.

There must be something you don't like or didn't like about japan, but for now you seems to be having fun in japan. I'm not a big fan of you, but as a fan, as a subscriber, I really like your home video type of video. simply it feels like sharing happiness of yours and its great. By the way, last time I watched your video was when you moved to japan. Compare to that video, i can see you are adapting to japan,  or more likely getting Japanese. What I meant is that, many Japanese love feeling seasons. Smelling, eating, touching, watching and eating again. Every month we do something related to season. January we celebrate New year and eat mochi, February we give valentine and endure severe cold winter with snow with Setsubun, March we have Ohinasama and ready to have spring with Ume as you did in this video. In April we  celebrate spring, sakura with the start of school(年度）, in May we get extra holidays generally called as ""golden week"" and get some little vacation with peach flower (momo no ki no hana), in June we get wet with Tsuyu (rainy season)with noisy semi and wait to see summer (vacation). In July we go Natsu matsuri and Hanabi. August we welcome and mourn ancestors with silent semi with smell of kou. In September, these days its still summer, but getting ready for fall season. For example, inakari( harvesting rice), Moon watching, higan bana and kinmokusei is ready to see, sakura trees most likely to change color by this time. In October, there's aki matsuri( fall festival) most likely harvest festival, which comes with kuri, mushrooms and etc. In November we get ready for winter. There's 7 5 3 events, most maples get turn in to red, so sightseeing is one of popular event. In December, its time to ready for Christmas time( more likely eating cake time or date time or Santa time for kids), then ready to end of the year. Generally we tidy up all rooms and ready for food to eat. Some may ready mochi, osechi, to stay in home and watch TV. Some may go to see end of the year live, some may go to temple for 108 bells, some may go to shrine to start dash the new year, some may go higher point to see sun rise. 
Sorry for messaging with such a essay. what I want tell is that, how you are having fun season is really great. Japanese watch, eat and feel every seasons by aging every year with sweet and bitter memories.

I would have so much more peace of mind for my child if I could. The US raises so many concerns for my child.,0,2025-03-19T15:10:26Z,2025-03-19T15:10:26Z

There would be others to take the next step, higher summits would inevitably be trodden, and kings crowned to rule them. He did not need them, he did not need their domain, and their accolades meant little to him. To truly win, he let go. He stayed his feet and remained the man who began the long march. Maybe his son will look back on Pewdiepie videos and wonder how his dad truly changed the world. But to Felix, his world is not so vast. This is his world, here in his arms, on his knee, and it is well won and spent. Live well and prosper my dude.",0,2025-03-18T20:08:17Z,2025-03-18T20:08:17Z

彼らは日本人に似ているので日本人になりすますことができる。
日本人の名前を語り、そして完全に日本人になりすましています。

I lived in the Tokyo area for 11 years, met my wife there, had a child there, and then moved to Canada for various reasons. We had a second child here in Canada, and just last year, our youngest visited Japan for the first time. Both of my kids are dual citizens, so they can easily live in Japan, even though they don't speak Japanese. My oldest used to be able to, but lost the ability since we moved to Canada when she was 4. She's studying Japanese now, though.

It's always been in the back of my mind that I want to live in Japan again. When we left Japan, I had a job I enjoyed, but we realised that we didn't want our daughter to be educated in Japan. That and my wife didn't want to stay in Japan. We've been in Canada for 9 years now, which I can't believe. There's a good chance that we'll inherit my in-laws' house in the future, which means we'll have a place to live if we decide to move to Japan. Watching Japan vlogs really gives me nostalgic feelings and a sense of longing for my old life. I truly loved living there. Time goes too fast.",0,2025-03-18T00:31:34Z,2025-03-18T00:31:34Z
